        <h2>The Service hallway.</h2>
        <p id="story">You peer down the service hallway. It’s narrow and dark, with barely enough space for two people to walk side by side. But it’s your only shot. Noah motions for everyone to stay close as you slip into the darkness.
            <br>
            <br>
            The walls close in around you, but you keep moving, knowing that stopping means certain death. The sounds of zombies grow fainter as you move deeper into the maze of back hallways.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally, you reach an exit—a heavy metal door leading to the parking garage. The cold night air hits your face, but you're not safe yet. You sprint through the shadows, weaving between abandoned cars. By some miracle, the garage is mostly clear.
            <br>
            <br>
            Noah lets out a breath he’s been holding for hours. “We made it,” he says, though his eyes betray a deeper wariness. The world beyond the mall is still overrun with zombies, but for now, you’re free.
