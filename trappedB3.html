        <h2>The Barricade.</h2>
        <p id="story">You decide to make a stand in the electronics store, barricading the entrances with whatever you can find. The shelves, the chairs, even the giant televisions—everything goes into fortifying your temporary fortress.
            <br>
            <br>
            At first, it feels like a good plan. But then, the pounding begins. You realize too late that the zombies have found a way in through the ventilation system.
            <br>
            <br>
            One by one, they drop into the store. The barricades you’ve built are useless. Noah swings his bat, but it’s no use. There are too many.
            <br>
            <br>
            The horde swarms, and the last thing you see is the flicker of a TV broadcasting static as the world fades to black.
