        <h2>The Stairs.</h2>
        <p id="story">You push against the door, but it doesn’t budge. The zombies are on the other side, relentless.
            Noah jams a crowbar into the crack, and with a sharp grunt, manages to force it open just enough to squeeze
            through.
            <br>
            <br>
            But as soon as you emerge, you see the full scope of the nightmare. The zombies have flooded the main level,
            and there’s no clear way out. One by one, they notice you. Their groans grow louder as the horde converges.
            <br>
            <br>
            “We need to move!” Noah shouts, but it’s too late. Mia stumbles, and before you can pull her up, the first
            zombie grabs her. Then another. The horde closes in, too fast, too many. There’s nowhere left to run. The
            last thing you see is Noah swinging his bat desperately before darkness overtakes you.
