        <h2>Staying hidden.</h2>
        <p id="story">You decide to stay put, hoping the zombies will lose interest and leave the store. The minutes stretch into hours, and the silence becomes unbearable.
            <br>
            <br>
            Suddenly, you hear a soft click. Noah’s face hardens, and before you realize what’s happening, he’s locking the door from the inside.
            <br>
            <br>
            “What are you doing?” you demand, but the answer is clear. He’s sacrificing you to buy himself more time.
            <br>
            <br>
            “There’s no room for all of us,” he mutters as he backs out, sealing you inside the break room with Mia and Abby.
            <br>
            <br>
            The last sound you hear is the groan of the zombies breaking through the door, moments before they tear you apart.
