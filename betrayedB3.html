        <h2>The Trap.</h2>
        <p id="story">You and Noah hatch a desperate plan—using the electronics to create a trap. You set up speakers
            around the store, wiring them to blast a high-pitched noise, loud enough to disorient the zombies. It might
            just give you enough time to escape.
            <br>
            <br>
            But as you’re setting the final speaker, you hear a soft click. Noah stands behind you, holding the remote.
            His face is cold, detached.
            <br>
            <br>
            “We don’t all make it out,” he says.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before you can react, he presses the button, flooding the store with noise. The zombies swarm, and you
            realize too late that you’re the bait. As they tear through the electronics section, Noah slips out the
            back, leaving you behind to face the horde.
