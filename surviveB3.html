        <h2>The Side Exit.</h2>
        <p id="story">You bolt for the side exit, praying it’s not locked. Noah is at your heels, dragging Mia behind him, her breaths coming in sharp gasps. The sound of zombies downstairs grows louder.
            <br>
            <br>
            The door gives way with a loud creak, revealing a stairwell that leads to a loading dock outside. It’s tight, claustrophobic, but you force yourself through, each step taking you farther from the danger behind.
            <br>
            <br>
            You hit the ground running as you emerge into the open air. The zombies swarm the mall, but the dock is clear. You race toward an abandoned truck, praying it’ll start. The engine roars to life, and with one final glance at the mall—the tomb you barely escaped—you speed away.
            <br>
            <br>
            Freedom. For now.
