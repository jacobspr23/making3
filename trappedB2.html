        <h2>The Break Room.</h2>
        <p id="story">You rummage through the break room, desperate for anything—food, water, weapons. But the room is nearly empty, save for a few scattered papers and some moldy snacks. There’s nothing useful here. Nothing but wasted time.
            <br>
            <br>
            Suddenly, a loud crash from the store sends your heart racing. The zombies have found a way in.
            <br>
            <br>
            Noah pulls you toward the door, but it’s too late. The groans grow louder. The sound of shuffling feet fills the small room as the undead close in. There’s nowhere left to go.
            <br>
            <br>
            The last thing you see before the darkness is Noah’s face, a grim mask of realization. The barricades weren’t enough, and now, neither are you.
