        <h2>Waiting it out.</h2>
        <p id="story">You all huddle in the maintenance room, praying the zombies will lose interest. Hours pass, the scratching on the door eventually fading. But you’re trapped. No way out. Tensions rise.
            <br>
            <br>
            Mia’s face grows pale, her injury worsening. You catch Noah giving her a long, hard look. His hand tightens around the hilt of his knife.
            <br>
            <br>
            Suddenly, he makes his move. “We can’t carry her anymore!” he shouts, but you know what he really means. He’s going to leave her behind to buy time. Abby screams, but before you can intervene, Noah slams the door behind him and bolts, leaving the rest of you trapped. The barricade won’t hold for long.
            <br>
            <br>
            The zombies pour in moments later. Abby’s screams echo in your ears as the undead tear through the barricade, leaving you no chance for survival.
